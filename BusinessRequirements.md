## Project Title
**Secure Access Thumb Drive Program**

## Project Description
Develop a small, portable software application that can be stored on a thumb drive. This application will enable any desktop or laptop it connects to, to replicate necessary security protocols required to log into the company's work environment securely. This ensures continuity of work with minimal disruption in case an employee's primary device is lost or stolen.

## Scope
- The application must be small enough to fit on standard thumb drives.
- The application should configure the host computer's environment to securely access the company's network.
- The application should work across multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Objectives
- Ensure secure and quick access to the work environment from any external computer.
- Minimize downtime due to device loss or failure.
- Maintain high security standards during access from non-standard devices.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR1:** The application auto-configures the host computer's VPN settings.
- **FR2:** The application installs temporary secure certificates to authenticate the user.
- **FR3:** The application cleans up all configurations and temporary files upon session completion.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1:** The application must execute within 2 minutes from activation.
- **NFR2:** Must support the latest versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **NFR3:** Must comply with international data security standards, e.g., GDPR and HIPAA.
